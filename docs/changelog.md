# Changelog

All notable changes to `capacitor-auth-manager` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.0] — 2026-10-09

### Breaking changes

- Node installation/tooling floor is now 24; iOS requires 15 and GoogleSignIn 10.x. Angular adapters support 22.x; older unverified ranges are removed.
- Web auto sign-in may return a popup access token instead of an ID token. Firebase handoff must use `GoogleAuthProvider.credential(idToken ?? null, accessToken ?? null)`.
- Default native storage no longer duplicates bearer credentials on disk. The Android legacy credential store and iOS credential copies are removed on upgrade; reauthentication may be required.

### Added

- `auth.prepare(provider)` initializes the SDK before a click without opening a sign-in prompt.
- A packaged AI integration guide for React/Firebase, native setup, exact imports, error handling, and session ownership.
- Google-flow, storage, provider initialization, and sign-out race regression tests; tarball smoke loads every public JavaScript entry in both formats.

### Fixed

- Missing requested nonce, expiry, subject, and Workspace-domain claims are rejected in the web ID-token path.
- Duplicate Google calls fail explicitly; provider initialization is coalesced and invalidated safely on disposal.
- A late session restore cannot authenticate after sign-out; disabled providers are excluded from the supported-provider list.
- One-Tap and popup waits are bounded; sign-out/disposal settles outstanding requests and late callbacks are ignored. Userinfo requests have a network deadline.
- Google web provider construction accepts the documented options shape.
- The packed Android manifest declares only INTERNET; consumer R8 rules preserve reflected plugin entry points.
- Native Swift/Java sources are included in the packed artifact. CommonJS root/framework adapters share one auth singleton, and providers/web exports its Google class.
- iOS credential copies no longer enter UserDefaults. Android removes deprecated security-crypto and keeps credentials in memory.

### Changed

- Direct dependencies updated to current stable versions, retaining the documented TypeScript 6 ecosystem pin.
- Android uses Credential Manager 1.6.0 and googleid 1.1.1; GoogleSignIn is 10.x.
- Yarn owns local build/test scripts. Trapeze tooling is retained for native configuration.


## [2.5.0] — unpublished source changes, 2026-09-08

Google sign-in hardened on every layer. Closes all five entries that `2.4.3` documented in
`docs/REPORTED-ISSUES.md`, fixes the runtime defects found while reviewing the native bridge, and gives the
native layers a real error-code channel. The Android plugin and the example app are **compiled and run on an
emulator** (Gradle 8.14.3 / AGP 8.13 / JDK 21 / compileSdk 36, emulator API 37) before release; the iOS
change below is the one part that no machine here can compile, and it ships unverified until the next iOS
device test.

### Fixed

- **ISSUE-001 — bare Node ESM could not import the package.** Every relative specifier in `src/` now carries
  its `.js` extension (155 specifiers across 41 files), so `dist/esm` resolves under Node's ESM resolver as
  well as under bundlers. Guarded by the new tarball smoke test.
- **ISSUE-002 — importing the package threw `window is not defined`.** The `auth` singleton is created lazily
  on first use (a `Proxy` keeps `import { auth }` unchanged), and `WebStorage` falls back to in-memory storage
  when `window` is absent or the browser refuses storage access (private mode). `"sideEffects": false` is now
  true.
- **ISSUE-003 — `@capacitor/core` was declared optional but required.** It is a required peer now.
- **ISSUE-004 — `capacitor-biometric-authentication` was installed for every consumer.** Removed from
  `optionalDependencies`; it returns as an optional peer when the biometric provider is re-enabled.
- **ISSUE-005 — `engines.node` was untested and disagreed with `.nvmrc`.** The floor is now `>=24.0.0`
  (owner decision: current and latest Node only, no legacy targets) and CI builds, lints and runs the tarball
  smoke test on Node 24 and 26. Node is a build/install requirement only — the package runs in a browser or a
  webview.
- **Web One-Tap dismissed by the user hung `signIn()` forever.** A dismissed prompt now rejects with
  `USER_CANCELLED`; a suppressed prompt rejects with `POPUP_BLOCKED` (or falls back, see Added).
- **Native `getCurrentUser()` returned `{}` and the app treated it as a signed-in user.** The bridge now
  normalizes any result without a string `uid` to `null`, so a cold start with no session is "signed out"
  instead of authenticated-with-an-empty-user.
- **Android `getCurrentUser()` resolved the same plugin call twice** when no provider was active. It answers
  exactly once and remembers which provider owns the restored session.
- **Android manifest declared `READ_SMS`, `RECEIVE_SMS` and `USE_BIOMETRIC`** for providers that are disabled.
  Only `INTERNET` remains; the SMS permissions are Play-restricted and were a store-rejection risk for every
  consumer.
- Per-call sign-in options (`nonce`, `loginHint`, the new flow selectors) now reach the native side; they
  were previously dropped because the manager flattens them before calling the provider.
- **`auth.getIdToken()` failed on iOS and Android** with `OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED` even though both native
  layers implement it, because the native bridge never exposed the method the manager looks for. It is
  implemented now, and the Android plugin method also accepts the flat `{ provider, forceRefresh }` shape
  the bridge sends (it previously read a nested `options` object only).
- **Native errors reached JavaScript without a code.** Android rejected with a bare message and iOS rejected
  with `localizedDescription`, so `AuthError.fromError` had to guess the code by substring-matching the
  message: anything that did not contain "cancelled", "network" or "timeout" surfaced as
  `auth/internal-error`. Both platforms now send a real `AuthErrorCode` — a cancelled sheet is
  `auth/user-cancelled`, an interrupted request is `auth/network-error`, a missing `serverClientId` is
  `auth/missing-configuration`, and so on. (Android verified on an emulator; iOS unverified, see above.)
- **Android fell back to plaintext `SharedPreferences`** when the keystore refused a master key, writing ID
  tokens to disk in the clear with no signal. It now keeps the session in memory for the life of the process
  and logs the degradation; `AuthStorage.isEncrypted()` reports which mode is active.
- **`npm run configure` emitted a `GoogleSignInOptions` manifest entry** from the deprecated
  `com.google.android.gms.auth.api.signin` flow this plugin stopped using in 2.4.2. Pasting it did nothing;
  the wizard now says Google needs no manifest entry.

### Added

- **`GoogleAuthOptions.webFlow`** (`'auto' | 'one-tap' | 'popup'`, default `'auto'`): One-Tap first, then a
  Google Identity Services OAuth2 **popup fallback** whenever the browser does not display One-Tap (cooldown,
  FedCM opt-out, third-party-cookie settings). The popup returns `accessToken` plus the Google profile;
  Firebase accepts `GoogleAuthProvider.credential(idToken ?? null, accessToken)`.
- **`GoogleAuthOptions.androidFlow`** (`'auto' | 'bottom-sheet' | 'button'`, default `'auto'`): the
  Credential Manager bottom sheet first, then the explicit **Sign in with Google button flow**
  (`GetSignInWithGoogleOption`) when no authorized account is offered — that flow can add an account.
- Both selectors are also accepted per call: `auth.signIn({ provider, options: { webFlow: 'popup' } })`.
- `getAuth()` export alongside `auth` for callers who prefer an explicit accessor.
- Web `getIdToken()` and `revokeAccess()` implementations (revoke uses the OAuth2 token when present).
- **Tarball smoke test** (`yarn smoke:tarball`, `node:test`): packs the package, installs the tarball into a
  scratch directory and imports it under bare Node (ESM and CJS). Wired into `prepublishOnly`.

### Changed

- `@capacitor/core` peer: optional → required.
- Android: `androidx.credentials` 1.3.0 → 1.5.0, `security-crypto` 1.1.0-alpha06 → 1.1.0 (stable),
  AGP/compileSdk/minSdk fallbacks aligned with Capacitor 8 (8.13.0 / 36 / 24), `lintOptions` → `lint`,
  the unused direct `play-services-auth` dependency removed (still provided transitively), Facebook/MSAL
  ProGuard rules dropped.
- `packageManager: yarn@4.17.1` declared so corepack picks the right Yarn.
- Google provider manifest no longer names a non-existent `@google/gsi` npm package.
- README: `renderButton` is documented as what it is — a method on `GoogleAuthProviderWeb`, reached by
  importing `capacitor-auth-manager/providers/web` — rather than implied to be on the `auth` singleton,
  where readers could not find it.

### Not changed on purpose

- iOS `GoogleSignIn ~> 7.1` stays. A major SDK bump without a compile check is not acceptable; it moves in
  a release that is verified on a Mac.

## [2.4.4] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **The README stated the previous version.** The at-a-glance `Version` row is a static duplicate of
  `package.json.version`, so it drifted the moment the version was bumped — it shipped stale in eight of the
  fleet's packages at once. The row, and any native version string, now move with the release.

## [2.4.3] — 2026-07-25

**Documentation and metadata only — no runtime changes.** Brings the package to the house README
standard and, importantly, **documents two High-severity defects that have been shipping since before
this release**. They are stated plainly in the README's Limitations section rather than left for a
consumer to discover at runtime:

- **The published ESM build does not resolve under bare Node.** `moduleResolution: "bundler"` emits 133
  extensionless relative specifiers across 33 files. Bundlers resolve them; Node's ESM resolver does
  not, so SSR, Node-resolution test runners and `node --import` all fail.
- **Importing the package throws `window is not defined`.** A module-scope singleton in
  `src/core/auth-manager.ts` constructs a `WebStorage` that reads `window.localStorage` unguarded. This
  also makes `sideEffects: false` untrue.

Neither is fixed here — both need a code change and a version bump beyond a documentation patch. Every
conventional gate passes while they ship: typecheck, lint, build, the exports-map walk and even an
esbuild bundle are all green. Only installing the tarball and importing it under bare Node catches them.
Tracked in `docs/REPORTED-ISSUES.md` as ISSUE-001 and ISSUE-002.

### Changed

- README rewritten to the canonical package pattern; `Readme.md` renamed to `README.md`.
- `homepage` moved off the npmjs.com page onto the documentation site.
- `funding` added; `keywords` reduced from 24 to 9 honest terms.
- `files` allowlist corrected to include the `bin` script explicitly; inert `.npmignore` removed.

## [2.4.2] — 2026-06-30

**Native now actually compiles — Google-only native (verified).** `2.4.1` shipped native sources that
had never been built in a real app; an end-to-end integration compile (a throwaway Capacitor app, real
Android `gradle assembleDebug` + iOS `pod lib lint`) surfaced and fixed the breakage. **Use `2.4.2`, not
`2.4.1`** (which is deprecated).

### Changed

- **Native is Google-only.** Removed the Facebook (`FBSDKLoginKit` / `facebook-login`) and Microsoft
  (`MSAL`) native dependencies so the plugin no longer drags heavy auth SDKs into every consumer app. The
  disabled providers' native code moved to `android/disabled-native-providers/` and
  `ios/disabled-native-providers/` (kept for re-enablement; not compiled, not shipped). `ProviderFactory`
  (Android) and `createProvider` (iOS) are trimmed to Google; the JS layer already reports
  `PROVIDER_NOT_ENABLED` for the rest.
- iOS podspec slimmed to `Capacitor` + `GoogleSignIn ~> 7.1`; removed the dangling
  `SWIFT_OBJC_BRIDGING_HEADER` (the file never existed; GoogleSignIn 7 is pure Swift).

### Fixed (native compile errors that blocked every consumer build)

- **Android:** `com.facebook.android:facebook-login:17.0.3` was unresolvable → build failed before any
  Java compiled. `GoogleAuthProvider` caught `GoogleIdTokenParsingException`, a checked exception
  `GoogleIdTokenCredential.createFrom` doesn't declare in googleid 1.1.1. `getIdToken` called the throwing
  `JSObject.getBoolean(...)` unguarded → unreported `JSONException`. Verified with `gradle :…:assembleDebug`.
- **iOS:** `CapacitorAuthManager` passed `AuthPersistence` / `AuthProvider` enums where the storage API
  expects `String` (`.rawValue`). `Plugin.removeAllListeners(_:)` now `override public`s Capacitor 8's
  built-in and delegates to `super`. Verified with `pod lib lint`.

> Both platforms now build in a clean Capacitor 8 app. Still verify Google sign-in on a real device before
> the fleet rollout (a successful compile is not a runtime test).

## [2.4.1] — 2026-06-30

**Google-first production refocus.** This release turns the package into a working, **Firebase-agnostic
Google authentication plugin** across **web, iOS and Android** — a drop-in alternative to
`@codetrix-studio/capacitor-google-auth`. The remaining providers are being re-enabled **one at a time**
as each is hardened and verified on device; until then they report a clear `PROVIDER_NOT_ENABLED` error.

> **Versioning note:** by maintainer choice this is a **patch**. Future providers land as **minor** bumps,
> fixes as patches, and a `3.0.0` only once all providers are working again. If your app used a non-Google
> provider on `2.4.0`, stay on `2.4.0` until that provider is re-enabled.

> **Native build caveat:** the iOS (Swift) and Android (Java) sources in this release were written to the
> official SDK contracts but are **not compiled in CI**. Validate `2.4.1` in **one** app (web + one Android
> device + one iOS device) before rolling it out to a fleet.

### Added

- **Native dispatch.** `auth.signIn(AuthProvider.GOOGLE)` (and the React/Vue/Angular `useAuth().signIn`)
  now route to the **native Google SDK on iOS/Android** and to **Google Identity Services on web** — the
  same call on every platform. Previously the modern API always ran the web flow, even inside a device webview.
- **`GoogleNativeProvider`** — a platform-bridge provider that delegates to the `CapacitorAuthManager`
  Capacitor plugin (native Google SDK) and returns `{ idToken, accessToken?, serverAuthCode?, user }`.
- **Android Google rebuilt on Credential Manager** (`androidx.credentials` + `GoogleIdTokenCredential`),
  replacing the deprecated, broken `GoogleSignIn` activity-result path (which never resolved).
- **Web Google rebuilt on the GIS id-token flow** (`google.accounts.id`) — no client secret, no backend;
  returns a Google `idToken` you can feed to `signInWithCredential(GoogleAuthProvider.credential(idToken))`.
- `AuthCredential.serverAuthCode`, `GoogleAuthOptions.iosClientId` / `filterByAuthorizedAccounts` /
  `autoSelectEnabled` / `nonce`, and `AuthErrorCode.PROVIDER_NOT_ENABLED`.

### Changed

- **Only Google is enabled.** The other 14 providers are un-registered and excluded from the published
  build; their web implementations remain in the repo for re-enablement. `signIn()` for any of them throws
  `AuthErrorCode.PROVIDER_NOT_ENABLED` with a clear message.
- **No secrets persisted by default.** The manager no longer writes `idToken` / `accessToken` /
  `refreshToken` / `serverAuthCode` to the default (unencrypted) storage — only a non-secret session
  snapshot. Short-lived tokens are re-derived via the provider's silent restore. Inject a secure storage
  adapter if you want token persistence.
- **Packaging:** `prepack` now builds `dist/` (so `npm pack` produces an importable tarball, not just
  `npm publish`); `prepublishOnly` runs build + lint; added `engines.node >=18`; `@angular/core` peer range
  widened to include `^22`; `CHANGELOG.md` now ships; added `./package.json` export; LICENSE copyright
  updated to 2024–2026.

### Fixed

- iOS Google: `emailVerified` was wrongly derived from the profile image; replaced the deprecated
  `UIApplication.shared.windows` presenter lookup.
- Web Google: removed the insecure client-side OAuth code→token exchange that required a `client_secret`
  in the browser.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-27

**No runtime behavior change.** Type-safety and tooling cleanup. Public types were tightened (see below), so TypeScript consumers may surface new, helpful type errors — hence a minor (not patch) bump. No public method was removed or renamed.

### Changed (type safety)

- Eliminated **all 37 remaining `no-explicit-any`** occurrences — the linter now reports **0 errors and 0 warnings**.
- **`StorageInterface` is now generic**: `get<T = unknown>(key): Promise<T | null>` and `set<T = unknown>(key, value: T)` (was `Promise<any>` / `value: any`). Existing custom-storage implementations remain compatible; direct callers now get `unknown` by default and should pass a type argument (`storage.get<AuthUser>(key)`) or narrow.
- **Angular adapter** method parameters now use real types instead of `any`: `configure(config: AuthManagerConfig)`, `initialize(config?)`, `signIn(options?)`, `signOut(options?: SignOutOptions)`, and `AuthModuleConfig.providers: Record<string, ProviderOptions>`.
- `catch (error: any)` blocks across the credential/biometric/registry providers now use a shared `getErrorMessage(error: unknown)` helper (`src/utils/error-message.ts`).
- `provider-registry` loader types and `platform` checks narrowed from `any` to precise types; `phone-password` backend payload and `biometric` credential params are now typed.
- Genuinely dynamic boundaries (optional-peer-dependency dynamic imports of `@capacitor/preferences` and `capacitor-biometric-authentication`) retain a single documented `// eslint-disable-next-line` instead of an undocumented `any`.

### Changed (tooling)

- Completed the ESLint 9→10 migration started in 2.2.0: renamed `eslint.config.js` → `eslint.config.mjs` and migrated the deprecated `.eslintignore` into the flat config's `ignores`. `npm run lint` output is now free of deprecation notices.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-05-26

**No breaking changes.** Backward-compatible minor release. This is an **internal refactor only** — no public method signature, runtime behavior, or provider list changed. There are still **15 web providers**.

### Internal

- Completed audit finding **F-39**: the 7 web providers that previously implemented `AuthProviderInterface` directly (`magic-link`, `sms`, `email-code`, `email-password`, `username-password`, `phone-password`, `biometric`) now extend the shared `BaseAuthProvider` — the same base used by the OAuth and Firebase providers. All **15** web providers now share one construction, event, state, and capability-detection path, removing the duplicated lifecycle/state machinery the audit flagged.
- Provider constructors accept **either** the injected `BaseProviderConfig` (factory/registry path) **or** the provider's own bare config object (direct construction), via a shared `resolveProviderConfig` helper. Existing `new XProvider(config)` usage from `capacitor-auth-manager/providers/web` keeps working unchanged.
- Per-provider `linkAccount`/`unlinkAccount` no-op throwers were removed in favor of `BaseAuthProvider`'s `OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED` defaults (completing F-44). Provider-specific capability behavior is preserved (biometric `unlinkAccount` and magic-link/sms/email-code `revokeAccess` still clear their stored/pending state).
- Base capability-default error messages reworded to a consistent "… is not supported by provider …".
- `no-explicit-any` lint warnings reduced from 45 to 37.

### Verification

- `npm run build` clean · `npm run test:run` → 79 pass · `npm run lint` → 0 errors (37 warnings).

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-26

**No breaking changes.** This is a backward-compatible minor release — no public method signature was removed or changed in a breaking way. It repairs broken runtime paths, hardens security, completes the stub providers, and updates dependencies. There are **15 web providers**: apple, biometric, email-code, email-password, facebook, firebase, github, google, linkedin, magic-link, microsoft, phone-password, slack, sms, username-password.

### Dependencies

- Updated all dependencies to current stable. Dev/build majors applied: `@types/node` 25, `eslint` 10, `typescript` 6, `@capacitor/*` 8, plus rollup, vitest, prettier, happy-dom, and others.
- Widened peer ranges so existing consumers are not broken:
  - `@capacitor/core`: `^7.4.2 || ^8.0.0` (optional — only for the native plugin / `CapacitorPreferencesStorage`).
  - `@angular/core`: extended through `^21.0.0`.
  - `react` `16.8`–`19`, `vue` `^3` remain supported.
- `@capacitor/preferences` is an optional peer, required only for `CapacitorPreferencesStorage`.
- iOS podspec deployment target raised from 13.0 to 14.0.

### Security

- **PKCE (S256)** added to the authorization-code OAuth flow (manual flows — Slack, LinkedIn) per RFC 7636: a `code_verifier` is generated and persisted with `state`/`nonce`, and `code_challenge` + `code_challenge_method=S256` are sent on the authorization request. Default-on for those flows; respects `pkceEnabled`. (Google uses Google Identity Services and Apple uses its SDK — both manage PKCE themselves.)
- **OIDC nonce + ID-token `exp` validation.** The returned ID token's `nonce` is compared to the stored value (`auth/invalid-nonce` on mismatch) and the `exp` claim is checked. ID-token **signatures are not verified client-side** — consumers must re-validate ID tokens against the provider's JWKS server-side before trusting claims.
- **Pluggable secure storage.** `configure()` accepts a `storage` option (any `StorageInterface`). New exported `CapacitorPreferencesStorage` backs storage with `@capacitor/preferences` (native key-value) so native tokens stay out of the webview's `localStorage`. The default web storage remains `localStorage`, which is readable by any XSS/third-party script — documented honestly; inject secure storage on native. Capacitor Preferences is not hardware-encrypted; use a Keychain/Keystore-backed adapter for secrecy at rest.
- **Biometric web fallback now uses real AES-GCM** with a non-extractable IndexedDB key, replacing base64 encoding (existing base64 values remain decodable for compatibility).
- **`client_secret` deprecated for browser use.** Browser-facing `clientSecret`/`appSecret` fields are no longer read in browser token/refresh/revoke calls (a secret in the JS bundle is recoverable) and emit a one-time warning when supplied in a web context. Fields kept for backward compatibility.
- **`AuthError.details` is sanitized** — token/password keys are redacted and only JSON-safe primitives are retained.
- CSPRNG (`crypto.randomUUID` / `crypto.getRandomValues`) used for UID fallbacks; developer-supplied credential endpoints warn if non-HTTPS.

### Fixes

- **Primary `auth` API was broken at runtime for OAuth and credential providers** — the provider registry constructed `BaseAuthProvider` subclasses with raw options instead of a `BaseProviderConfig`, so storage/logger/options were `undefined`. The registry now builds a proper config and injects shared storage + logger. This repaired path is what the React/Vue/Angular adapters use.
- **Credential threading** — `auth.signIn({ provider, credentials })` now reaches credential providers correctly (credentials spread to where each provider reads them).
- **Provider name resolution** — underscore enum values (`username_password`, `email_code`, `phone_password`, `email_magic_link`) now resolve to the correct registry loaders; added missing loaders for `email-code` and `phone-password`.
- **Session restore** now runs after `configure()` supplies providers, so a persisted session is rehydrated on reload (previously the auto-init-in-constructor left it dead).
- **GitHub sign-in completes** via a developer-supplied `tokenExchangeProxy` (alias `tokenEndpoint`); the per-init `message` listener and popup interval no longer leak. Without a proxy, sign-in throws `auth/missing-config`.
- **Slack and LinkedIn fetch real user profiles** (Slack `openid.connect.userInfo`, LinkedIn `/v2/userinfo`) instead of returning hardcoded placeholder identities.
- **Firebase sign-in method** is derived from standard options/credentials, with a new `defaultMethod` fallback (previously branched on an undocumented field the manager never sent).
- **Microsoft** per-sign-in `scopes`/`loginHint`/`prompt` are mapped explicitly into the MSAL request.
- **Passwordless pending state** (SMS / email-code / magic-link) is persisted (non-secret metadata only) so verification survives reload/redirect.
- Auto-refresh timer no longer overflows the 32-bit `setTimeout` ceiling for far-future expiry; an untargeted `signOut` clears all refresh timers; `refreshToken` token access is null-guarded.
- `web.ts` `getIdToken` no longer double-parses already-parsed storage; `getCurrentUser` isolates per-provider failures and sets the current provider; Apple `refreshToken` returns `auth/operation-not-allowed`; SMS/email-code `refreshToken` return `auth/operation-not-allowed`.
- In-memory `persistence: 'memory'` now correctly maps to in-memory storage (previously fell through to `localStorage`).

### Features

- **Account-management methods on the `auth` singleton** (and surfaced through the React/Vue/Angular adapters): `linkAccount`, `unlinkAccount`, `revokeAccess`, `getIdToken`, `updateProfile`, `deleteAccount`. Each delegates to the active provider and throws `auth/operation-not-allowed` if unsupported.
- New `isProviderConfigured(name)` and `getConfiguredProviders()` accessors on the singleton (also used by the adapters instead of reaching into private state).
- New config field `GitHubAuthOptions.tokenExchangeProxy` (alias `tokenEndpoint`) and `FirebaseAuthOptions.defaultMethod`.
- New exports: `WebStorage`, `CapacitorPreferencesStorage`, `StorageInterface`, and the shared `defaultLogger` (plus `Logger`, `LogLevel`, `LoggerConfig`).

### Internal

- **Centralized logging.** All package logging routes through a `Logger`; zero direct `console.*` calls remain outside the logger module. Default level `warn`; adjustable via `VITE_LOG_LEVEL` / `LOG_LEVEL` (build-time) or `defaultLogger.setLevel()` (runtime). The logger deliberately does not patch the host's global `console` or read the host's `localStorage` (documented deviations appropriate for a published library).
- All standalone providers throw `AuthErrorCode` enum members instead of bare string codes; added additive enum members (e.g. `CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED`, `INVALID_CODE`, `CODE_EXPIRED`, `INVALID_TOKEN`, `STORAGE_ERROR`, `PROVIDER_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION`).
- Typing: replaced `any` in exported public types with concrete types. One acknowledged widening to a precise type — `AuthManagerConfig.providers` is now `Record<string, ProviderOptions>` instead of `any`. Reduced SDK-boundary `any` (minimal interface shapes for Firebase/MSAL/Facebook/GitHub) and internal mapper typing (lint `no-explicit-any` warnings 138 → 45).
- Extracted provider manifest data into `provider-manifests.ts` (registry file 752 → 281 lines).
- tsconfig `moduleResolution` `node10` → `bundler`, `module` `ES2020` → `ESNext`, added `rootDir`; ESLint consolidated onto unified `typescript-eslint` (dropped the banned `@eslint/js`).

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds; `npm run test:run` — 79 tests pass; `npm run lint` — 0 errors.

## Earlier releases

`0.0.1`, `0.0.2`, `1.0.0`, `1.1.0` and `2.1.0` were published before this changelog was started, and no
per-version record of them was kept. They are listed here so the gap is visible rather than silent; the
published artefacts remain on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/capacitor-auth-manager?activeTab=versions). Treat `2.2.0` as the first
release with a documented history.
